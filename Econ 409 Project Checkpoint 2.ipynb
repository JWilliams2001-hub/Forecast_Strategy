    "### Conceptual framework and explanation of our forecasting strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For this sector-specific strategy, we will use the S&P 500 Energy Index (S5ENRS) as the price series and its Earnings Yield as the fundamental indicator.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Conceptual Framework\n",
    "This strategy is grounded in the theory of Mean Reversion as it applies to valuation metrics within equity sectors. We hypothesize that while sector prices can deviate significantly from their intrinsic value in the short term due to market sentiment or commodity price volatility, they tend to revert toward a historical valuation mean over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Asset:** The S&P 500 Energy Index (S5ENRS), which tracks major oil, gas, and energy service companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Fundamental:** We are using the Earnings Yield ($\\frac{Earnings}{Price}$) for the Energy Sector as our fundamental indicator.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Theory:** In a mean-reverting framework, a high Earnings Yield (where earnings are high relative to the price) suggests the sector is undervalued and likely to see future price appreciation. Conversely, a low Earnings Yield suggests the sector is overvalued.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bloomberg Link:** (One of these series (S5ENRS Price or Earnings Yield) must be pulled from the Bloomberg Terminal.)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Intuitive Explanation of Strategy\n",
    "Our forecasting strategy employs a Z-Score Filter to identify when the Energy Sector’s valuation has reached an extreme deviation from its historical average.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Signal:** We calculate the Z-score of the current Earnings Yield relative to its historical moving average. This tells us how many standard deviations the current yield is from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Filters (Hyperparameters):** We establish an Upper Filter and a Lower Filter to trigger trades.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Entry (Buy):** When the Earnings Yield rises above the Upper Filter (indicating the sector is significantly \"cheap\" or undervalued), the strategy generates a long signal and enters a position in the Energy Sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exit (Sell):** We exit the position and move to the risk-free rate when the yield reverts and crosses back below a Lower Filter (indicating the sector has returned to \"fair value\")."
